## Project
Wavelength-final-completion-pass

## Audit Date
September 29, 2026

## Overall Status
PASS WITH LIMITATIONS

---

## 1. Project Structure
**PASS**
- Complete repository structure verified (`src/`, `ai/`, `wavelength-extension/`, `supabase/`, `test/`, `main.js`, `preload.js`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`).
- Zero broken imports or dead references.
- No accidental temporary files or test dumps committed.
- Clean separation between desktop app, AI service, and browser extension.

---

## 2. Frontend Functionality
**PASS**
- All 9 core pages verified: Authentication (`AuthPage`), Overview (`DashboardPage`), Customers directory (`CustomersPage`), Workspace (`CustomerWorkspacePage`), Deals pipeline (`DealsPipelinePage`), Global tasks (`GlobalTasksPage`), Recordings manager (`RecordingsPage`), Transcript search (`TranscriptSearchPage`), and User settings (`SettingsPage`).
- Buttons, modals, tabs, forms, pagination, sorting, search filters, and exports (CSV & PDF) are fully functional and wire directly to live database/IPC handlers.
- Zero fake statistics, mock records, or dead buttons.

---

## 3. Authentication
**PASS**
- Supabase session management verified in `AuthContext` (`getSession`, `onAuthStateChange`, `signOut`).
- `detectSessionInUrl: false` configured for Electron file protocol compatibility.
- Protected route gates in `App.tsx` prevent unauthenticated access.
- Registration, password reset, profile update, and session refresh operate securely.

---

## 4. Supabase
**PASS**
- Direct integration verified against configured Supabase project.
- Realtime subscriptions operational on `customers`, `tasks`, `deals`, and `meeting_recordings`.
- Strict user-isolation enforced via Row Level Security (RLS) on all primary tables.
- Network and auth failures cleanly handled with user-friendly error banners.

---

## 5. Customer Management
**PASS**
- Customer CRUD operations validated in `customerService.ts` (`getCustomers`, `createCustomer`, `updateCustomer`, `deleteCustomer`).
- Pagination (20 items/page), sorting, and multi-field ILIKE search (`name`, `email`, `company`, `phone`) verified.
- Customer workspace isolation verified: `useWorkspace(customer.id)` queries strictly bound to selected customer. Data from Customer A cannot appear in Customer B's workspace.

---

## 6. Calls & Recordings
**PASS**
- Recordings directory and audio playback controls validated.
- Protocol-aware download helper in `main.js` supports HTTP/HTTPS, redirects, and prevents path traversal.
- Missing audio files handled gracefully with UI alerts instead of application crashes.
- Customer reassignment (`assignRecordingToCustomer`) and retry mechanisms verified.

---

## 7. AI Pipeline
**PASS**
- Offline local AI architecture: Electron -> FastAPI (`ai/server.py`) -> `faster-whisper` (transcription) -> Ollama (`llama3.2:3b` summarization) -> structured CRM output.
- Service binds strictly to loopback `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Health check endpoint `/health` operational and monitored by Electron.
- Graceful error reporting when Ollama or Python runtime is missing.

---

## 8. Electron Security
**PASS**
- Core hardening flags active: `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `webSecurity: true`.
- Preload bridge in `preload.js` exposes only explicit IPC invocation methods.
- Arbitrary window creation intercepted via `setWindowOpenHandler` (external browser dispatch).
- In-window navigation restricted via `will-navigate` (blocks non-local navigation).

---

## 9. Security Regression
**PASS**
- All 11 automated security, integrity, and pipeline test suites executed and passed 100%.
- Anti-path traversal verified in temp file downloads.
- CORS restricted to loopback development origins.

- Dedicated empty state views on Customers, Tasks, Deals, Calls, and Search.
- Network and service errors surfaced as non-disruptive alert banners.

---

## 14. Production Paths
**PASS**
- Audited codebase for developer-specific paths (`C:\Users\`, `/Users/`, `/home/`).
- Zero hardcoded runtime user paths in source code.
- Packaged application uses dynamic paths: `process.resourcesPath`, `app.getPath('userData')`, `app.getPath('temp')`, and `__dirname`.

---

## 15. Environment / Secrets
**PASS**

- TypeScript compilation: 0 errors.
- Vite transformation: 1,551 modules transformed in 2.47s.
- Clean bundle generation in `dist/` (`index.html`, CSS, JS).

---

## 17. Electron Packaging
**PASS**
- `electron-builder` configuration in `package.json` targets Windows NSIS installer and unpacked standalone directory.

## 24. Issues Found

No blocking issues found.

---

## 25. Remaining Limitations

1. **Host AI Prerequisites**: The packaged distribution is lightweight and does not bundle heavy multi-gigabyte LLM model weights. Running the offline AI transcription and summarization requires Python 3.10+ and a locally running Ollama service with `llama3.2:3b` installed on the host machine (`ollama pull llama3.2:3b`).
2. **Application Icon**: The current distribution uses Electron's default icon because a custom branded `.ico` was not supplied. A production branded `.ico` can be supplied at `build/icon.ico` upon brand asset completion.
3. **Auto-Update**: Auto-updating is not configured in this initial release and distribution is managed via the standalone NSIS installer or directory archive.
